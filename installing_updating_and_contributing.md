## Install Lens locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >=0.8.x
- Google Chrome

Node.js is just used a development enviroment. You'll soon be able to create self-contained packages of the individual modules our the main app itself.

### Fresh install

1. Install the Substance Screwdriver command line utility. It's just a little helper that hels you deal with our modules.

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/substance/screwdriver.git
   $ cd screwdriver
   $ sudo python setup.py install
   ```

2. Clone the Lens Mothership

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/elifesciences/lens.git
   ```
  
3. Run the update command, which pulls in all the sub-modules and dependencies

   ```bash
   $ cd lens
   $ substance --update
   ```
  
4. Finally start the server and point your browser to `http://localhost:4000`

   ```bash
   $ substance
   ```

You can have a look at the example document, by pointing your browser to `http://localhost:4000/#lorem_ipsum` or view the autogenerated Lens.Article documentation here `http://localhost:4000/#lens_article.
   
   
## Keep your local version in sync

You may want to pull in updates every now and then, which is simple. In the Lens project root dir do:

   ```bash
   $ substance --update
   ```
   
And start the dev environment again.

   ```bash
   $ substance
   ```

## Contributing

I'm assuming here that you have push access to the repositories, because as a start I'd like to get the Lens core dev team up and running. I'll provide documentation on how to work with a forked version of a module and submit a pull request soon.


Say you've made changes to the Lens.Article module. In order to commit them you simply have to navigate to `node_modules/lens-article` and do:

   ```bash
   $ git add <YOUR STUFF>
   $ git commit -m "Fixed X"
   $ git push
   ```
   
Alternatively, if you working on breaking changes you can switch to a different branch, and submit a pull request using the Github interace. Here's how

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b my_feature_branch
   $ git add <YOUR STUFF>
   $ git commit -m "Fixed X"
   $ git push
   ```
   
Then go to [Github](http://github.com) and submit a pull request.

Another hint: To pull in upstream changes from master for the entire project do this:

```
substance --git -- pull origin master:<feature_branch_name>
```
